Blog API Application with CRUD Operations, JWT Authentication, Versioning of REST APIs  and Swagger REST API Documentation


1. CRUD Operations:
The API allows you to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, likely using HTTP methods like POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.
And same activities for comment posts

3. JWT Authentication:
API protects sensitive endpoints by requiring JWT tokens, ensuring only authorized users can access and modify data.
This typically involves generating and validating tokens based on user credentials, and potentially refreshing expired tokens.

4. Swagger Documentation:
Provides comprehensive and interactive API documentation using Swagger, making it easier for developers to understand and use our API.
This typically includes descriptions of endpoints, request/response parameters, and potential error codes.

5. Versioning:
API is likely versioned, allowing users to specify which version they want to use in their requests.
This helps manage changes introduced in new versions while ensuring compatibility with existing clients.
Versioning strategies can include using the URL path (e.g., /api/v1/posts), HTTP headers, or query parameters.
